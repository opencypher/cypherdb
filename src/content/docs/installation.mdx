CypherDB is an embedded graph database that can be used from the command line and from
a variety of programming languages. This page shows all the ways you can install CypherDB.
After installation, you can learn how to run CypherDB by [creating your first graph](/get-started).

:::note[License]
All source code and pre-compiled binaries of CypherDB are distributed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/opencypher/cypherdb/blob/master/LICENSE). By installing and using CypherDB, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
:::

## Command Line (Shell)

If you don't need CypherDB embedded in your application, you can use the CLI shell. This is a standalone
executable with no dependencies that can be used to interact with a CypherDB database using just Cypher.

<Tabs syncKey="cli">
<TabItem label="Linux">

Use a tool like `curl` to download the latest version of the CypherDB CLI to your local machine.
<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.cli.linux} lang="bash" frame="terminal"/>

Now you can run CypherDB from the command line.

```bash
./kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

You can install the CypherDB CLI using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install kuzu
```

You can now run CypherDB from the command line.

```bash
kuzu
```

Alternatively, you can download the CypherDB CLI directly.

<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.cli.macos} lang="bash" frame="terminal"/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">

Use a tool like `curl` to download the latest version of the CypherDB CLI to your local machine. Alternatively,
simply open 
<a href={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.cli.winUrl} target="_blank">this URL</a> in your browser.

<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.cli.win} lang="bash" frame="terminal"/>

Right-click on the `kuzu_cli-xxx.zip` file and click on **Extract All**. This will create a directory
containing a file named `kuzu.exe`. Then, right-click on the directory and click "Open in terminal".
From within the terminal, you can then run `./kuzu.exe`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Nix">

On Linux, macOS, and WSL2, you can also use [`Nix`](https://nixos.org/learn) to run the CypherDB CLI.

Run CypherDB in a temporary shell:

```bash
nix-shell -p kuzu
kuzu
```

Alternatively, you can install CypherDB declaratively using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-package-management) or [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration:

```nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.kuzu ]; // NixOS
  home.packages = [ pkgs.kuzu ];              // Home Manager
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Python

You can use `uv`, `pip`, or `nix` to install the CypherDB Python client library.
The instructions are the same for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

<Tabs syncKey="python-package-manager">

<TabItem label="uv">

```bash
uv init
uv add kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pip">

```bash
pip install kuzu
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="nix">

```bash
nix-shell -p "python3.withPackages (ps: [ ps.kuzu ])"
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Node.js

Use `npm` to install the CypherDB Node.js client library.

```bash
npm install kuzu
```

## Java

The latest stable version is available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.opencypher/cypherdb).

<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.java} lang="xml" frame="terminal"/>

## Rust

Use Cargo to install the CypherDB Rust client library. This will by default build and statically link CypherDB's C++
library from source. You can also link against the dynamic release libraries, as described in the [crate docs](https://docs.rs/kuzu/latest/kuzu/#building).

```bash
cargo add kuzu
```

## Go

CypherDB's Go API is a wrapper around the C API of CypherDB. The installation step below assumes that you have
initialized a Go project that has a `go.mod` file, as described in [the official tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module).

<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.go} lang="bash" frame="terminal"/>

## Swift

To add `kuzu-swift` to your Swift project, you can use the Swift package manager.
1. Add the package to your Package.swift dependencies.
    <Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.swift} lang="swift" frame="terminal"/>

    You can change the branch to a tag to use a specific version (e.g., {version} for the latest stable release or `main` for the latest development version).

2. Add `CypherDB` to your target dependencies.
    ```swift
    targets: [
      .target(
        name: "YourTargetName",
        dependencies: [
          .product(name: "CypherDB", package: "kuzu-swift"),
        ]
      )
    ]
    ```

Alternatively, you can add the package through Xcode:
1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to `File` > `Add Packages Dependencies...`.
3. Enter the URL of the kuzu-swift repository: `https://github.com/opencypher/cypherdb-swift`.
4. Select the version you want to use (e.g., {version} for the latest stable release or `main` for the latest development version).


## C/C++

Use a tool like `curl` to download the latest version of the CypherDB C/C++ binaries to your local machine.

The CypherDB C++ client is distributed as a so/dylib/dll+lib library file along with a header file (`kuzu.hpp`).
Once you've downloaded and extracted the C++ files into a directory, you can link it to your C++
program by adding the directory to your build system's search paths.

<TabItem label="Linux">

<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.cxx.linux} lang="bash" frame="terminal"/>


</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

<Code code={DOWNLOAD_LINKS.cxx.macos} lang="bash" frame="terminal"/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">

## CypherDB Explorer

CypherDB Explorer is a web-based GUI for CypherDB. It allows you to explore and query your CypherDB database
using a web browser. Refer to the CypherDB Explorer [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kuzudb/explorer)
for more details.

## CypherDB MCP Server

Our [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server allows you to expose
your CypherDB database as a tool that can be used by LLMs and agents.
Refer to the CypherDB-MCP [GitHub repo](https://github.com/opencypher/cypherdb-mcp-server) for more details.

## Nightly Builds

If you want access to the latest features in development, you can use our nightly builds.

- Python: `uv pip install --pre kuzu`
- Node.js: `npm i kuzu@next`
- Java: The latest snapshot version is available on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/opencypher/cypherdb/packages/2258307)
- For the CLI, C/C++ shared libraries, and Rust crate, the latest nightly versions for each can be
downloaded from the latest run of [this GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/opencypher/cypherdb/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml).
